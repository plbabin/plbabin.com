## Hello! I'm Pierre-Luc Babin!

![image](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71bc55f8402e72d15a57cd37bf68ae89?s=60)
I am a JavaScript Engineer at [Help Scout](https://helpscout.com/). Most of my days are spent writing code with [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/). Previously I was a Technical Archiect at [Universal Mind](https://universalmind.com/) and a Web Developer at [Duproprio](https://duproprio.com/). When I am not in front of a computer, I am busy raising two kids, watching the [TV Show _du jour_](https://www.tvtime.com/en/user/903430/profile), learning the [guitar](https://www.gretschguitars.com/gear/build/hollow-body/g5410t-electromatic-rat-rod-hollow-body-single-cut-with-bigsby/2506811569) or playing [board games](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/plbabin).

I am also a huge sports fan, cherring for the [Green Bay Packers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers), the [Boston Red Sox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox) and for any hockey team except the [Montreal Canadiens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Canadiens). I am still waiting for the [Nordiques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Nordiques) to be back in Quebec City, but I don't really believe it will happen one day!
